All eligible regular-season and playoff games are enrolled before start, including games without odds (unpriced games are excluded only from paired market metrics). First review after 100 settled games; enrollment continues. Unknown starters/lineups stay unknown. Delays or source conflicts can leave coverage gaps. These are experimental forecasts, not betting recommendations.
